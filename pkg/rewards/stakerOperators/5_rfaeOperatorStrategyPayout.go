/**
 * This view calculates the tokens returned to each operator for rewards_for_all_earners on a per-strategy basis
 *
 * 1. avs_opted_operators: Get the operators who have registered for an AVS for a given snapshot
 * 2. reward_snapshot_operators: Get the operators for the avs's strategy reward
 * 3. staker_delegated_operators: Get the stakers that were delegated to the operator for the snapshot
 * 4. staker_avs_strategy_shares: Get the shares for staker delegated to the operator
 * 5. rejoined_staker_strategies: Join the strategies that were not included in rewards_for_all_earners originally
 * 6. staker_strategy_weights: Calculate the weight of a staker for each of their strategies
 * 7. staker_strategy_weights_sum: Calculate sum of all staker_strategy_weight for each (staker, reward, snapshot)
 * 8. staker_strategy_proportions: Calculate staker strategy proportion of tokens for each reward and snapshot
 * 9. staker_strategy_tokens: Calculate the tokens returned to each staker on a per-strategy basis
