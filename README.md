# EigenLayer Sidecar

The EigenLayer Sidecar is an open source, permissionless, verified indexer enabling anyone (AVS, operator, etc) to access EigenLayerâ€™s protocol rewards in real-time.

A core responsibility of the Sidecar is facilitating the calculations of [rewards](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/rewards-claiming/rewards-claiming-overview) distributed to stakers and operators by AVSs.
